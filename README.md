# Overview 
To further my understanding of React.js, APIs, and server-side database interactions, I will be creating a web app that simulates a client side rendering of a business that prepares meals as per the client's orders. The client has the option of picking up from a delivery point, or having their order dropped off to them. As well the client reserves what time they would like their order prepared by, and has the option to  
The app offers drop-off location options and time reservations. 

I have intended areaa of focus which I will move onto one-by-one as I feel they are sufficiently completed. 
My list of learning focuses will not be completed in any particular order. I will update which order I complete them in as I do so. 


Languages (libraries, frameworks)
- Javascript (React.js)
- Python (Flask, FLASK-SQLAlchemy, Jinja2)
- Google API
- HTML (CSS)
- PostreSQL


## **Areas of Focus**
*Database constructed as I move on to the related focus*

### Build ordering page
*Create interactive page where client constructs their meal from available options*
*Search bar to find preferred food options*
    
### Make user account
*Create a login to an account where client can:*
- *Choose a location to pick up their their orders*
- *Reserve a drop off time*
- *Access history of previous orders*
