# Overview 

In order to further my understanding areas of React.js, APIs, and database interactions with the back-end, I will be creating a web app that allows users to order food from a delivery service that prepares the meals. 
The "real world" service I am trying to simulate is that of the client side rendering business that prepares healthy meals as per the client's orders. The client has the option of picking up from a delivery point, or having them 
The app offers drop-off location options and time reservations. 

I have my intended area of focus which I will move onto one-by-one as I feel they are sufficiently complete. My list of learning focuses is not completed in any particular order. I will be updating which order I complete them in as I do so. 


Languages (libraries, frameworks)
- Javascript (React.js)
- Python (Flask, FLASK-SQLAlchemy, Jinja2)
- Google API
- HTML (CSS)
- PostreSQL


## ** Areas of Focus **
* Database constructed as I move on to the related focus

### Build ordering page
* Create interactive page where client constructs their meal from available options
Search bar to find preferred food options *
    
### Make user account
* Create a login to an account where client can:
- * Choose a location to pick up their their orders
- * Reserve a drop off time
- * Access history of previous orders
